I can help you manage your budget, with my in-built budget calculator!

To enable budgeting, first type `/use_budgeting`.

Then, set a monthly budget (amount of money available) with `/set_monthly_budget <amount>`.

You can then add expenses with `/add_expense <amount> <category>`, which will be added to the current month, and expenses of the same category will be grouped.

For an overview of the expenses in the current month, type /show_this_month_expenses. For a graph of expenses over time, type /expenses_graph.

Type `/help <command>` for help with the commands!
